# Choosing-a-compiler: performance testing GCC vs ICC vs ICPX vs NVCC vs CLANG vs HIP
Used to host public versions of my various test files and relevant launch scripts.

Usage:
Clone this repository. 

This is done with 
'git clone https://github.com/FCLC/Choosing-a-compiler-performance-testing-GCC_ICC_ICPX_NVCC_CLANG_HIP/'

Enter the directory:

cd Choosing-a-compiler-performance-testing-GCC_ICC_ICPX_NVCC_CLANG_HIP/

Use this repo:

Step 1
run ./compile.sh 
(if you can't run the file, execute 'chmod +x ./compile.sh' then try again)

Step 2
run ./profile.sh
(if you can't run the file, execute 'chmod +x ./profile.sh' then try again)


Otherwise, for a more specific test, go to the relevant sub directory using the cd command and run the scripts in said directory
